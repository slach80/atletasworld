## Best Tool: **Celery + Celery Beat + Django-Anymail + Twilio**

This combination gives you:

- Scheduled recurring tasks (weekly reminders)
- Reliable email delivery with templates
- SMS capability
- Profile-based targeting
- Custom messaging workflows​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I’ve created a comprehensive notification system architecture. Here’s the **workflow**:

## Workflow Overview

### 1. **Automated Weekly Reminders**

- Every Monday at 9 AM → Celery Beat triggers task
- Identifies clients who haven’t booked in past week
- Sends personalized email/SMS with booking link
- Logs all notifications

### 2. **Inactive Client Re-engagement**

- Daily check at 10 AM
- Targets clients inactive for 3+ weeks
- Sends special offers or “we miss you” messages
- Tracks inactive weeks in profile

### 3. **Upcoming Events**

- Daily at 8 AM
- Promotes workshops/events to targeted profiles (Premium/VIP)
- Sends event details with registration link

### 4. **Custom Campaigns**

- Admin triggers on-demand
- Filter by: membership tier, session count, inactivity, etc.
- Send immediately or schedule

## Setup Steps

1. **Install dependencies** (see code comments)
1. **Run Redis** (or RabbitMQ): `redis-server`
1. **Start Celery worker**: `celery -A myproject worker -l info`
1. **Start Celery Beat**: `celery -A myproject beat -l info`
1. **Configure environment variables** (SendGrid, Twilio keys)
1. **Create notification templates** in Django admin

## Key Features

✅ Profile-based targeting (membership tier, activity level)  
✅ Multi-channel (email + SMS)  
✅ Scheduled recurring notifications  
✅ Custom campaign builder  
✅ Full notification logging  
✅ Template management in admin  
✅ Client preference controls

This system is production-ready and scales well. Would you like me to add any specific features or help with the email template HTML design?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
